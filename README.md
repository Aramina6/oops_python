## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. It helps in organizing code, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. This repository explores the core principles of OOP in Python, providing theoretical insights and practical examples.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data withi
